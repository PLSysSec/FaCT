If merlin does not tell you the answer, look at the rest of the codebase.

Do not use tabs for indentation. Keep line lengths below 80 characters.

Ensure your code compiles before you check it in.

If you can't find the answer anywhere, use [these guidelines](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/guidelines.html)
