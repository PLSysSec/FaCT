* Details:    Performs known-answer tests on the corresponding AES
              implementation. These tests do not encompass the full
              range of available test vectors and are not sufficient
              for FIPS-140 certification. However, if the tests pass
              it is very, very likely that the code is correct and was
              compiled properly. This code also serves as
	          example usage of the functions.
